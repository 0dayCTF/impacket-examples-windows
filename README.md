* Compile examples based on the pcapy library


Disclaimer & licence 
---------------------
* Do not use it for illegal purposes
* I don't own anything on the impacket nor CORE Security brand and am not affiliated with this project and organization 
* Last but not least, antivirus softwares might report some binaries as hacktools or even malwares: this is a known and common issue. If you don't trust this compilation: 
  1. Just don't download it.
  2. Compile it yourself, with the help of [that tutorial](https://github.com/maaaaz/CrackMapExecWin/wiki/How-to-compile-CrackMapExec-for-Windows)
